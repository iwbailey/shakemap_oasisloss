* shakemap_oasisloss

Aim is to use a shakemap as an oasis footprint and estimate the loss to a set
of locations

* Success
  1. Successful estimate of portfolio loss and location level loss uncertainty
     distribution
  2. Function that can add footprint to a list of existing footprint database
  3. Vulnerability function processing and add to database

* Components needed
  - Read in a shakemap and add it to a list of footprints
  - Framework for defining the geographic scope of footprints (USGS Vs30 grid?)
  - Framework for reading in locations and assigning them to calculation points
  - Setup allows us to define vulnerability functions at defined damage levels
    for whatever intensity measure
    - Flexibility to define 2-d intensities?
  -

* Next actions
  - Download full vs30 grid, define calculation point id based on that
  - Create class that defines an oasis footprint on the grid
